- It's a complex psychological measure of information.  
- with many application and 
- long history of analysis and research

## What is eye movement?
--- 
- human eyes has very limited cone for visual system and its been concentrated in fovea.  
- And the fovea is quite small. 
- **Visual Angle:** To project object on the fovea, the size of the object and distance is important. this can be calculated by visual angle. 
    - Visual Angle = (Object size/distance) 
    - 1 radian = 360/2pi = 180/pi
    - 1 cm = 1/57*180/pi = 1.005 degree
### Types of ye Movement
- **Tremor:** physiological noise in muscle control [< 1˚, 20-25˚/s]
- **Drift:** slow movements taking the eye away from fixation. [200-1000 ms, 1-60˚]
- **Vergence:** binocular focus, both eyes move together. 
- **Vestibular-ocular reflex:** correct for head movement by producing eye movements in the direction opposite to head movement. 
- **Optokinetic reflex:** smooth pursuit + saccade 
- **Smooth pursuit:** moving object
- **Microsaccades:** small eye movement at fixation. [10-30 ms, 10-40˚, 15-50˚/s]
- **Saccade:**  is a quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation in the same direction. [30-80 ms, 3-20˚, 35-900˚/s]

### Active vision perspective
- Vision is not passive
- Movement is essential for vision
    - no fixated = missed 
    - Covert attention is active (microsaccades)
    - stable image = vision fades 
- Important because shows that eye movement are intrinsically inked with information processing. 

## Eye movement and information processing
___
- Human do not use saccades t paint a complete internal representation of a visual scene. 
- Scacades constitute a way to select task relevant information. 

### While reading:
- Content words are fixated more than 'function' words. 
- Distribution of attention is asymmetrical: (3.4 letters to the left, 14-15 to the right of fixation) 
- 10-15% of the time readers move their eyes back - regress 
- For difficult text: 
    - Saccade size decreases
    - fixation duration increases 
    - regressions increase

## Eye movement recording 
___
### Eye Trackers 
- Mechanical 
- photograph of reflection of light source 
- Suction cup with mirror - high acc
- Electromagnetic coils - high acc
- Eletrooculography (EOG) - low acc 
- Video Based: 
    - Desktop: EyeLink - pupil corneal reflection. 
    - HeadMount
#### Properties of eye trackers: 
- Temporal resolution 
    - wide range: 25hz - 2000hz
    - Faster but not so accurate 
    - Affects what measures can be calculated. 
- Spatial 
    - resolution
    - Spatial accuracy: Average angular distance between fixations locations and corresponding locations of fixation targets. 
    - Spatial precision: RMS of angular distance between successive samples. variance of the blue dots around fixation target. 
#### Gaze Estimation approach
1. Model-based
2. Appearance-based 
Example: DeepEye


## Eye movement Analysis
---
- Saccades and fixations
    - Latency
    - Direction 
    - Duration
    - Amplitude 
    - Velocity, acceleration, deceleration. 
    - trajectory
- Higher order measures: AOI
    - AOI hit
    - AOI dwell time 
    - AOI over time 
    - **Challenges:**
        - Defined apriori
        - Overlapping AOIs
        - Size of AOI
        - Inaccurate calibration
    - **Scan paths**
        - Viewing pattern
        - different across people 
        - different across tasks
