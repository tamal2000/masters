# Knowledge Representation 
______

# Definitions: 

* Syntax 
* Semantics 
* Interpretations and models 
* Entailment
* Calculus
* Soundness, Completeness and Termination 
* Decidability  
- Given a simple application problem you should be able to determine which syntax and semantics belong to a logical system that would addrress the problem 
- Given a sa simple new logical systm you will have to identify the syntax and semantics of this language informally 
- Weather a given algorithm is sound and complete for the system. 

# propositional Logic

* Translate a natural language text or the description of simple problme into a PL represnetaion 
* Calcualte the clause notmal form of a PL formula 
* given the truth table for a new logics operatiosn 
* check formulas for entailment, valididy, satisfavibity, equivalence 
calcualte models for formulast
- show satisficabilty and entialment of pL formulas using DPLL 
aplly the different heurigues dppl procedude

# Description Logic 
- Syntax: Concept, ABoxes, TBoxes 
- Negation Normal Form (NNF)
- Semantics 
- Interpretation: (domain + set theoretics interpretation function (classes as sets, instances as objects, roles as relation, model))
- Tablues Calculus 
- Tabluea with TBAX blocking 
- MOdel a problem described in natual languge as DL concepts and axioms 
Calcualgte NNF of the concppet KB
- Determine weather an interpreation si a model or not
- prove satisfaictibity of a concpeot
