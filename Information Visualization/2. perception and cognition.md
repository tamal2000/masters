# Perception & Cognition 

### 1. How do we look at thing 
- rapid eye movement (saccade) 
- We do not store visual information 
- Visual features: by neurons 
    - orientation and size 
    - gray and color 
### 2. Visual Thinking 
- #### Gestalt Law
    - Proximity 
    - Similarity 
    - Focal point 
    - Continuity 
    - Symmetry 
    - Closure 
    - Figure and ground 
- #### Types of visual thinking 
    - Bottom-up 
    - Top-down 
- #### Highlights of Visual Thinking 
    - We do visual queries to see the world 
    - We only remember what is related to talk (limited capacity)
- #### Visual thinking model/Eye movement planning  
    - **What pathway** object identification, color and size bias
    - **Where pathway** Location information, guiding actions 


### 3. Perception Primitives 
- Pop-out effects thats draw general attention. 
- Works
    - Motion: Strongest pop out 
    - Color: strongest static pop-out 
    - Shape: works 
    - Size: works 
    - Depth of field: Blurring is a fantastic way to draw attention and reduce emphasis on info that is not relevant. 
    - Orientation: not at strong 
    - Number: for small amount 
    - enclosure: strong emotion 
    - Addition: pops out too 
    - Shading: Niche techniques (convex/concave)
- Doesn't work
    - Parallelism 
- Compounding visual perceptions not always works 
- #### Laws of preattentive display 
    - Color 
    - Simple Shape (size, orientation)
    - Motion 
    - Depth 
    Max one of each at a time, 
    only some conjunction works 
        - shape and color 
        - multiple shape and color - works for rearranged ones 
        - color and motion 
        - color and position 
        - shape and position 
        spatial location + one aspect of form 
- Visual design lessons 
    - Orthogonality: use a different channel for different types of information 
    - Highlight by two properties: conjunction with separable dimensions 
        - Highlight 
        - color change
        - box 
        - italic 
        - underline (also for link)
        - strike-through (negative)
        - blinking 
    - Less is more: what not to include
    - Reduce cognitive load for not required ones 
    - enhance perception to the important ones 
    - designers must be skilled in data science
