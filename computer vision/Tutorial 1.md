# Tutorial 1: Exercises Lecture 2 and 3

**EXERCISE 1**  
Given, 
- Intensity, I: Purity of the color, 
- Chromaticity, xy: color quality (independent of luminesce), 
- Hue, H: appearance of color (blue, red, green)
- Saturation S, intensity of color (highly saturate blue will look bluish) 

- Sunlight, S: X = Y = X = 100. 
- Artificial lamp, A: X = 100, Y = 100, Z = 150

**1.a:** Calculate the intensity I of the two light sources A and S.  
__Ans:__ Intensity = (X + Y + Z)/3  
S<sub>I</sub> = (100 + 100 + 100)/3 = 300/3 = 100   
A<sub>I</sub> = (100 + 100 + 150)/3 = 350/3 â‰ˆ 117

**1.b:** Calculate the chromaticy values x = X/(X + Y + Z), y = Y/(X + Y + Z) and plot these in the chromaticity diagram given in Figure.  
__Ans:__   x = 100/(100+100+100) = 1/3, y = x = 100/(100+100+100) = 1/3, Z = 1 - (x + y) = 1 - 1/3 - 1/3 = 1/3   
A, x = 100/(100+100+150) = 0.286, y = x = 100/(100+100+100) = 0.286, Z = 1 - (x + y) = 1 - 0.286 - 0.286 = 0.428   
**1.c:** What is the estimated hue of light source A with S as reference white light?
__Ans:__ parent color? The straight light of A and S connect at 470 nm. so 470 is the dominent wavelenght. so hue of A is 470.  

**1.d:** Rank the light sources with respect to their saturation.  
__Ans:__  A is more saturated than S.  

**1.e:** Plot the colors which are produced through the mixture of S and A.  
__Ans:__ Straight line from A and S
