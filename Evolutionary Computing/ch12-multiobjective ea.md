# Multi objective Evolutionary Algorithm 

## Important Points
- Multi Objective problems coocur very frequently 
- EA are very good in solving multi - objective problems 
- MOEAs are one of the most successful EA subareas
- Number of objectives is typically low in practice and research. 2/3

## Multi objective optimisation problem MOP
- Preto optimality
- EA approaches
  - Evolutionary spaces
  - Preserving diversity
- wide range of problem can be categorised by the presence of n possibly confliting objective 
- two problems: finding a set of good solutions
- objective vs solutions space 
- Dominance relations: pareto-optimal set, pareto-optimal front

## Goal of Multiobjective optimisers
- convergence: as close as possible to the pareto-optimal front
- diversity - spread, distribution 
- two vs multiobjective: 
  - preference based aka aggregation based approach
  - real multiobjective apprach. 
- EA apprach: populatin-based natures means EA can simultaneously search for a set of points approximating pareto front 
- requirements: 
  - fitness: usaulaly baed on dominance
  - maintain diversity: challenging 
  - remember all good points : usings elitism
