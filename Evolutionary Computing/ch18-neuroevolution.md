# Neuroevolution
- can avoid local optimal by explicit diversity maintence 
- creativity and interesting solutions rather perfect
- can used for supervised, and unsupervised learning 
- blacblox, computationally expensive 

## NEAT: Neuroevolution of augmention topologies 

## CPPNS: Compositional pattern producing Networks 

## Hyperneat: 
- producing creating a neuralnestwork with a c CPPN making a neural network with another neural network.
