# Visual Analytics
The science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces. 
- A domain expert wants to solve a problem 
- The solution comes from analyzing a large, complex datset
- iteratively and interactively 

## Typical Aspects
- Dashboard Style interface
- Multi view design 
- individual views are basic charts and plots 
- interactive intelligent model to assists the users
- good integration of viz and model through interaction

## Evolution
Selection -> Preprocessing -> Transformation -> Data Mining -> Interpretation -> KB
## Visual Pipeline 
- Data: 
    - transformation(cleaning,selection, integration) - vis
- Visualization: 
    - user interaction(Exploring data and model) - vis
    - Model building: user feedback interaction  - model 
    - making observation in vis - > kB
- Model: 
    - mode/parameter: change structure, choose different model -> model 
    - model drives the vis(showing relavel vis) -> vis
    - interpreting model; param -> kb
- KB: 
    - Model building: data mining, stat techniques, ml - >data
    - feedback loop:  select enw data 

### Sense making process:
-  Structuring unknown data into a framework to comprehend, understand, explain, attribute, extrapolate and predict. 
    - Foraging loop: seeing infromation and expand it
    - sensmaking loop: interaction development of mental model 
    - reality/policy loop 
    - External data source:
    - Shoebox: filter based on relevance: bottom-up/top-down: 
    - Evidence File: snippeets from shoebox; read extract/ search for relation 
    - Schema: well organized collection of informaiton: puting stucture, search evidence 
    - hypothsis:representation of the conclutoins about the data; tell story, lead to new hypothesis
    - Persentation 

## Machine Model vs Mental Model

## Desing Takeways
- making challenging data accessible 
- Q-type error thre; because your vis doens't make a point , vis is always about allowing th eusers
- for using trifecta - Q in Va mean - sufficient interactive support for meaning ful high-level tasks. 
- fully supporitn connections is challenging
- domain specific and task specific 
- model should be desinged alongside the vis
- iterate waterfall planning 
- Good practice
    - prreprocessing in 
    - model in backend 
    vis in the fronted 
    - keep the state 
    - interection: 
        - selct
        - explore
        - reconfig 
        - encode
        - abstract
        - filter 
        - connect 
    - challenge
        - computational: explore, filter, abstract/elaborate
        - efficient data structure: reconfig, encode, connect 
    - techniques
        - survery
        -   overview all key modeling approches 
        - as trasnspernt as possible 
## VA Modeling tecniques
- Modify parameters(MP)
- Define Analytical Exprctation (DAE)
- Dimention reduction 
- Clustering
- Classification
- Regression
