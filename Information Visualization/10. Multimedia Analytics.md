# Multimedia Analytics

## Multimedia: A new variable type
- Collection:
    - Content: actual raw multimedia data
    - Annotations: Text associated with item (labels, comment, caption, tags)
    - Metadata: Tabular( Categorical, ordinal numerical geo)
- Computed/derived:
    - Features: machine-extracted descriptions 
    - Similarity: choice of metric top of features
    - Statistics: Summary 
## Multimedia Analytics
Multimedia Analytics = visual analytics + multimedia analysis 
- Visual Analysis: 
- Multimedia analysis: model based on advanced automated multimedia analysis. ml, cv, info retrieval 

## Multimedia Data
- what is it: plant species, architecture style, summer/spring
- Where is it: localize the flag 
- Additional Knowledge
    - Subjectivity: personal opinion  
    - Context: related to others 
- Human perception
    - easy, 
    - semantic information 
    - excellent data analysts 
    - complex abstract semantics 
    - instant recognition  
    - put in context
- Machine Perception
    - feature representation of the data 
    - extract semantic information 
    - limited semantics 
    - takes time to recognize 
    - No context 
- Similarity: Ecludean, Cosine, Mahalanobis 

## Multimedia Visualization 
- Key ingredients:
    - text, metadata
    - multi view design 
    - visualizing visual data 
- Image: show the image
- Video: itself or extract key frames 
- Taxonomy: 
    - Basic Grid
    - Similarity-space:  dimensionality reduction method
    - Similarity based:  results of a content-based query
    - Image Spheres: part of grid 
    - landscape 
    - spreadsheet: meta data by side 
    - Thread-based : originating from center 
- Desirable Aspects: 
    - Efficiency; 
    - Navigability among dimensions 
    - Heterogeneous data support 
- Comparison: 

## Multimedia Analytics Model 
- Intelligent Assistance: 
    - Four tiers:
        - objective 
        - Procedure
        - Intends 
        - Methods 
    - Integrated Model: 
        - medical science; 
            - objective: find cancer
            - Procedure: scan, search for symptoms  
            - Intends: sorting patients based on liver abnormality 
            - methods: computing the rank 
- High-level tasks 
- exploration: collection beforehand and wants to discover what’s in it/understand it. The mental model is dynamic
- search: he user has a very clear idea what she’s looking for and just wants to find it
ranking, finding items, structuring, search, browsing, summarization 
- Limitations: very rigid and pre-defined range of semantics 
- Usefulness: ML technique, feature representation, categorization
- Interactive Learning: 
    - Scale: 100 million images 
    - Blackthorn: keep only small number of features per image  = 1L on 1000M
    - Exquisitor: faster: hierarchical clustering to leverage the structure of data set
