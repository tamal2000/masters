# Constraint Handling

## important points
- Constraints are everywhere
- FOP - CSP - COP scheme
- indirect constraint handling: make it an objective befre the EA is applied 
- Direct constraint handling: take care of it during EA run

## Motivation
- EA shows good ration effort/performance
- EAs are acknowledges as good solvers for tough problems

## Free search: 
- standar mutation and crossover preserve membership of S
- problecm can be defined through objective function optimization and constraints satisfied

## Constraint satisfaction Problems
- feasiblity condition 
- feasible search pace 
- CSP by EA must be transformed to a FOP or COP
- indirect constraint handeling - transforming the constraint into an object
- direct constraint handeling - taking care that the constraint is respected, during running ththe eA

## Indirect pro's and con's
