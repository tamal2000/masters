# GEO and Temporal Data

## Dimensions of Temporal Visualization 
- Frame of Reference
    - Spatial: Growth map (ring map, color-season, size-number, color intensity-year)
    - Abstract: Horizon Graph - time development over a number of data pints. 
- Time Primitives
    - Instant points:  Cycle plots 
    - Intervals: Gantt-Chart
- Arrangement 
    - Linear: linegraph with dimention 
    - Cyclic: Spatial plot 
- Mapping 
    - Static: trail plot  
    - Dynamic: bubble chart animation 
- Time Primitives:
    - Ordered 
    - Branching 
    - Multiple perspective time 

## Analyzing time series data 
- Interaction: analysis task 
- Temporal data abstraction: reduce quantitative variable to qualitative
    - state
    - Gradient
    - Rate 
- Clustering: group data and represent 
- Event Detection: identify events 

## Geophysical 
- Mercator: most famous online map. 
    - A cylindracal project 
    - keeps angles and shapes 
    - distors areas 
- Albers: a conic project used by geological survery
- Choropleth: fill region with color 
- heatmaps on maps 
- symbol map: choropleth + simple viz 

## Spatiatemporal Visualization
- showing Temporal and spartial data jointly
- prone to clutter
- solution: space-time cube 
- **Tobler's first Law:** Everything's related to everything else, but near things are more related that distant things. 
    - interpolation and extrapolation
    - intergration of information 
    - spatial and tempral interface 

- Scale 
- Smooth navigatioon : panning + zooming
