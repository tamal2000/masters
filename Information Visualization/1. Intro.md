# Introduction 

## Topics: 
1. What is InfoVis 
2. History & current disciplines 
3. Organization of the course 

## VisInfo History: 
starts with second count of variables objective 
- prehistoric era: lines 
- Babylonian: base 60. two basic for 1 and 10 
- Egyptian: base 10, aware of large number, fraction
- Hindu-Arabic: current, math convenience, arithmetic operation simplified, arbitrary precision, positional notation. zero. 
## What is Information Visualization: 
- Goal: design a visual representation of data that enables or facilitates useful understanding. 
- Math-style: mapping between data and visual representation. 
- Communication of abstract data through the use of interactive visual interface. 
- InfoVis utilizes computer graphics and interactions to assist human in solving problems 
- Teh study of visual representation of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. 
- The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representation of abstract data to amplify cognition. 
## Data types: 
- 7 basic types:   
    - 1, 2, 3 dimensional 
    - multidimensional 
    - Temporal 
    - Trees 
    - Networks 
- Modern era: 
    - Geospatial 
    - Multimedia - text, audio, video, audio 

## Variable Type: 
- Different statistical techniques and plot different variables differently. 
- Qualitative: categorical/nominal (names, lables)
    - Ordinal: rank ordering of the entities measure 
- Quantitative:
    - Interval (ordinal): the difference between two values are meaningful. 
    - Ratio: true zero, ratios between arbitrary values are meaningful. 

## Visual representation 
- Business Graphics: building blocks for analytic dashboards 
    - table: best practices 
        - vertical liens: not useful 
        - Horizontal lines: 3 (2 for header, 1 for bottom)
        - Alignment: left- align 
        - numbers right aligned 
        - equal decimal precision (3 digit)
        - round up to useful to the purpose 
    - Chart: 
        - label, title, legend important 
        - y-axis should always start from zero 
        - avoid double y-axis 
        - change aspect ratio for better visualization 
    - Pie Charts: (ask why not bar, Humans are better comparing lengths than areas)
    - right chart for right data: 
        - line graph: variable develops over time
        - bar chart: comparing relative differences between few items 
        - table: calender view ???
- Information Design: story to tell with supported data 
    - Info graphics, data GIFs  
    - political discourse and news reports 
- InfoVis: Individual visual representation of the data.
    - An innovative visualization, a new way to represent the data, a new graph/chart 
    - Data -> Visualization -> knowledge 
- Visual Analytics: Enable tackling datasets otherwise though impossible to analyze. (Multimedia analytics)
    - The science of `Analytical reasoning` facilitated by `interactive visual interfaces` 
    - Improved 'flow' of the analytics process itself. 
    - Data -> visualization <-> Model <-> Knowledge 
    - Analyzing a large, complex dataset 
    - Iteratively: it takes time and a gradual approch to grapple with the data 
    - Interactively: static visualization don't cut it. expert has to perform many subtasks to process, hands on approach. 
- Scientific Visualization: Models (3d), scientific data 

## Disciplines by data scale: 
- Business Graphics (10) -> Information design (100) -> InfoVis(1k) -> Visual Analytics (1M)
