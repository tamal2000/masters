# Human Information Processing
- What are the limitations of human information processing 
- So that during design we can consider that. 

## Brain Structure and Function
- Frontal lobe: Thinking, memory, behavior and movement. [front]
- Parietal lobe: Language and touch [top middle]
- Occipita lobe: sight [top behind]
- Temporal lobe: hearing, learning and feeling. [middle]
- Cerebellum: balance and coordination [Very back]
- Brain stem: breathing, heart rate and temperature. [very centre]

## Human Information Processing as per cognitive science: 
1. Stimuli
2. Short-Term Sensory Store: information from outside world enters in our brain and kept in short term sensory store. 
3. Perception: The initial process of the raw sensory information is done by perception. Try to interpret ambiguous sensory input. 
4. Decision and Responses Select: Further process of information is done to select appropriate response. 
5. Response Execution: perform the selected response. 

Attention Resources: For all types of information processing we need attention resources. 
Memory: two types of memories to perform information processing. 
- Working Memory (limited memory to perform important task, thinking fast).
- Long term Memory (memory needed in future, not immediately is stored in long term memory, thinking slow ). 

## Visual Processing: 
- One the most important processing. 
- Anatomic estimate: 10 to 15 percent cortex devoted to visual processing.
- Functional Estimate: 50 to 60 percent of brain is used. 
### 1. Sensation
**Visible Light:** The visual light is very small fraction of the electromagnetic wave. Wavelengths between 400 nano meters to 700 nano meters.   

**Limitations of Retina:**  
**Color:** Three types of cones in retina to view different part of wavelengths. 
- **Blue Cones:** for short wavelengths. 
- **Green Cones:** for medium wavelengths.
- **Red Cones:** for long wavelengths. 
- **Rods:** Low light and processing motion. 

Not everyone can view all the spectrum equally. So during the design phase its import to understand that many users may have only two types of visual cones. 
- **Protanopia**: Loss of red cones 
- **Deuteranopia**: Loss of green cones. 

**Structure of Retina**
- The distribution of rods and cones are very homogeneous. 
- **Fovea:** Color cones are concentrated in very small part of retina in centrally. 
- **Periphery:** outside of part of retina mainly contains rods. highly specialize for processing motion. helps to detect danger.
- **Eye Movements** We need eye movement for high visual and color accuracy. save brain from unnecessary information. 
- **Blind Spot:** 20 degree in phobia has a blind sport with no cones or rods. optical nerves are connected here. 
  - Size: 7.5ยบ height and 5.5ยบ wide.
  - Location: 12-15ยบ in temporal visual field and 1.5ยบ below the horizontal. 
  - Fills up by most likely information. 
### 2. Perception 
Interpretation of our sensory input.  
Why is this important: perception works based on previous experiences, surrounding of the problem.  
- Solving Inverse problem. [the fact that projection in retina is 2d but it transforms to 3d.]
  - Accommodation: how munch to bend our lense to fix at a position. 
  - Convergence: looking at peraral to identify how far the object is from us. distance within 3m from eyes. 
  - Binocular disparity: The sensory difference between two eyes. 
- Depth/Pictorial cues
  - Linear perspective
  - relative size
  - interposition
  - light and shadings
  - texture gradients. 
- **8 Gestalt laws of grouping**
  - Low of Proximity
  - Low of Similarity 
  - Law of closure 
  - Symmetry
  - enclosure
  - connection 
  - figure & ground 
- **Affordances**
  - human face recognition 
- **Predictions**
  - Auto-correlation 
  - whole-parts 
  - priming 

### 3. Attention: Competition among current goals, physical salience and selection history and scene context. 
- Humans are functionally blind without attention.   
- We can not process all the information that we receive.   
- Attention is a mechanism to process particular information. 
- This can be viewed as bottleneck.  
- **Definition:** Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seems several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others. - william james. 
- Attention determines which information is processed and which information is ignored. 
  - how is it determined?
  - To what extent is attention selective? 

* Selective Attention in Audition: 
  * Cocktail party effect. you are able to selectly listen one speaker at a time. 
  * when someone shout your name get attention. 
  * **Dichotic Listening technique:** different information in different ear but focus on only one ear. 
    - Shadowed ear: the fcous on
    - unattended ear: not focus
  - Early selection (Broadbent):
      - filter theory
      - bottleneck at stimulus-identification
      - filtering based on physical dimentions, location, loudnes 
  - **Filter Attention Theory - Treisman**
    - Cocktail party effecgt
    - relevant information passes the filter. 
  - **Deutsch & Deutsch**
    - Bottleneck occurs after stimulus-identification. 
#### **Visual Attention:**
* Directing visual attention:
  * Spatial: selectively of location 
  * Feature based: based on features such as color, orientation of size.  
* Visual Search: 
  * Feature Search: search time doesn't change much for on set size. 
  * Conjunction search: more difficult and increase linearly. 
* What drives visual search: 
  * Bottom-up processing 
  * Salience map: 
    * first parallel input stage for many feature maps. 
    * Slow and sequential focal attention stage. 
  * Top-Down
  * Selection History: reward - learned redward value directly modulates the visual salience of reward.
  * Integrated priority Map: Selection bise 
    * Current goals
    * selection history
    * Physical salience 

### 4. Memory
- Iconic Memory: When we get the information we keep it for 0-250 ms 
  - easily overwritten by new stimuli
  - decay quickly 

- Visual working memory: 250 ms - seconds. 
  - stores visual information for a few seconds so that it can be sued in the service of ongoing cognitive tasks 
  - can survive eye movements, eye blinks, and other visual interruptions. 
  - A limited amount of information to be maintained in an 'on-lin' or readily accessible state. 
  - Content - specific activity 
  - Contralated delay activity CDA
- Long term: hours - days - years
  - No capacity limitations Experimental paradims
  - eye movement based memory effects
