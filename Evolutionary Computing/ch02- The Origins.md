# The Origins

## Fathers of Evolution Computing 
- Charles Darwin 
- Francis Crick & James D. Watson - DNA
- Alan Turing & john von Neumann - Computer 

## Important Points 
- Historical Dialets 
  - Gentic Algorithm 
  - Evolution Strategy 
  - Evolutionary Programming 
  - Genetic Programming 
- Umbreall term of principle algorithm: **Evolutionary Algorithm**
- Name of field: **Evolutionary Computing
- Enveloping fields: bio-inspired computing, natural computing, computational fintelligence, artifical intelligence
- Biological inspiratin & terminology 
- Not necessarily bilogical plausibility 
  - Bio-chemical grounding is missing 
  - Simplified mechanims 
  - Biologically impossible/ non-existing mechanisms are OK for applications 

### Motivition of EC
ROBUST PROBLEM SOLVING technology needed, i.e., algorithms that work on 
a wide range of problems without much problem specific adjustment  

Nature has always served as a source of inspiration for engineers and scientists

## Darwinian Evolution:  Survival of the fittest 
- all environments have finite resources 
- life forms have basic instinct greared towards reproduction 
- some kind of selection is inevitable 
- those individual that compete for the resources most effectively have increased change of reproduction 

Phenotypic traits:
Physical & behavioural differences that affect response to environment
Partly determined by inheritance, partly by factors during development (nature vs. nurture)
Unique to each individual, partly as a result of random changes

- Population consists of diverse set of individuals
-    Individuals are “units of selection”
- Population is "unit of evolution"
- Absense of "guiding force"

## Genetics 
- DNA contains the information required to build a living organism 
- Genotype (DNA inside) determines phenotype (outside)
- small changes in genotype lead to small changes in the orgnism 
- genes are encoded in strands of DNA called chromosomes 
- there are two copies of each chromosome 
- The complete genetic material in an individual's genotype is calle genome 
- A species as almost same genetic materials. human contains 3 billion DNA based pairs with 20k genes. 99.9 percent identical n evey person. 
### Reproductive cells 
- Cells with only one copy of each chromosome are called haploid
- Gametes are formed by a  special form of cell splitting called meiosis
- During meiosis the pairs of chromosome undergo an operation called crossing-over
### Mutation 
- reproduction error 
   - catastropics 
   - neutral 
   - advantageous 
### Fertilisation 
- Zygote: new person cell 
- process of differential behaviour during development is called ontogenesis 
### Genetic Code 
- all proteins in life on earth are composed of sequence built from 20 different amino acids 
- DNA is built from four nucleotides in a double helix spral 
- For all natural life on earth, the genetic code is the same !

### Transcription, translation 
- DNA - transcription -> RNA - translation -> Protein 
- Genetype -> phenotype 
- GEntype <!- phynotype
